            <h2>Our history</h2>
            <p>
                Lyrical Movements' dance studio space was designed and built by Hamilton architect McMillan in 1934 as a lodge and dance hall for the children of the city of Hamilton. Its architecture was concived thinking on the best families of the city would send their children to learn the art of dancing to this academy. The exterior features stylized geometric ornamentation rendered in cast concrete and remains in substantially original condition. Much of the interior has been renovated in order to keep with the highest standards of the market. Several of our dance parents and grandparents remember attending social functions in the hall as children.
