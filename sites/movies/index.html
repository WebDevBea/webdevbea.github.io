                    The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>, among many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as <em>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter</em>, have been built at several Universal Parks &amp; Resorts amusement parks around the world.
