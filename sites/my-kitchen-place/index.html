                <h2>Backsplash</h2>
                <div class="row centered gap20 wrap">

                    <div class="col16">
                        <h3>Ceramic Tile</h3>

                        <p>Ceramic tile is the most popular option for a kitchen backsplash. Ceramic tiles are incredibly versatile—they come in many shapes, sizes and colors and can be installed in numerous patterns.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col16">
                        <h3>Porcelain Tile</h3>
                        <img src="images/backsplash_2.jpg" alt="Porcelain tile" class="responsive">

                        <p>While ceramic tile is made by firing and glazing wet clay, porcelain tiles are made from compressed clay dust fired to high temperatures. Porcelain tile is not typically glazed, comes in fewer varieties and lacks the more decorative options of ceramic, but it is longer lasting.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col16">
                        <h3>Glass Tile</h3>
                        <img src="images/backsplash_3.jpg" alt="Glass tile" class="responsive">

                        <p>Glass can offer a unique backsplash thanks to the variety of shades, shapes and designs. In addition to different colors, shapes and patterns, glass tile also offers different levels of reflectivity: glossy, frosted, matte and iridescent, which is the newest type of finish that reflects all colors of light and is best for sunlit rooms.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col16">
                        <h3>Wood Tile</h3>
                        <img src="images/backsplash_4.jpg" alt="Wood tile" class="responsive">
                        <button type="button" class="slide-toggle">Read More</button>

                        <p>While not an obvious choice for a kitchen backsplash, wood options do exist. They are typically less expensive than most options, although they have drawbacks. Wood isn’t naturally waterproof, so if it’s not laminated then a special sealant needs to be used to make it a viable backsplash. With painting and staining, the appearance of a wood backsplash look is flexible, but it also requires ongoing maintenance to retain its look.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col16">
                        <h3>Peel-and-Stick Tile</h3>
                        <img src="images/backsplash_5.jpg" alt="Peel-an-stick tile" class="responsive">
                        <button type="button" class="fadeTo">Read More</button>

                        <p>Peel-and-stick backsplash is part of the home decor DIY trend. This type of tile is adhesive and is applied as a relatively temporary backsplash. (High-end options can last a few years.) It is typically vinyl though it is also available in materials like metal, glass and stone. Most peel-and-stick tile can be cut with scissors, though special materials require special tools.</p>

                        <h3>Thermoplastic Tile</h3>
                        <img src="images/backsplash_6.jpg" alt="Thermoplastic" class="responsive">
                        <button type="button" class="fadeInOut">Read More</button>

                        <p>Thermoplastic panels can provide the look of a more expensive backsplash material. It is a durable option, and because of its relatively easy installation, it can be completed via DIY for handy homeowners. Because of its smooth surface it’s also easy to clean.</p>
